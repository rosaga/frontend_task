# Front End Dashboard Task

This is a React project application that fetches and renders the list of dashboards available to a DHIS2 user.


## Deployment

The project is deployed and accessible at [Dashboard App](https://frontend-task-two-pi.vercel.app/).


## Overview

This application offers a dashboard view to manage and visualize data from an API

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

   * Clone the repository.
   * Navigate to the project directory.
   * Install dependencies using yarn install.   
   * Start the application with yarn start.

## Major Decisions

    * **Tech Stack**: The project utilizes React for the front-end, enabling a modular, reusable, and responsive user interface.
    * **Data Management**: Data loading and manipulation are handled through API calls and custom utility functions. Mock data is used in the test environment to simulate API behavior.
    * **Testing**: The test suite includes unit tests for utility functions and integration tests for UI components. It employs Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive coverage.
    * **Component Structure**: The dashboard system is composed of modular components, allowing scalability and easy maintenance.







### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
